# Google's Foobar Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to [Google's
foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) challenge.

Google's foobar challenge is a series of programming challenges created by
Google in order to find potential new hires. To take part, you must be invited
through one of two ways: Googling certain programming-related keywords to
trigger an invite, or receiving an invite from someone who has already taken
part .

The challenge is split into 5 levels. Each level has a number of challenges that
must be completed in order to progress to the next level, with the difficulty of
the challenges increasing with the level. The challenges must be completed
within a given time-frame, ranging from a week to a month depending on the
level. To complete a challenge, you must submit Python[^1] (or Java) code that will
pass a number of test cases within time constraints. To make things more
interesting, all the test cases are hidden except for two.

## Challenges

The challenges I received are as follows (there are many more challenges, but
each participant is given a random subset for each level):
* Level 1
    * re-id
* Level 2
    * hey-i-already-did-that
    * power-hungry
* Level 3
    * fuel-injection-perfection
    * queue-to-do
    * bomb-baby
* Level 4
    * distract-the-trainers
    * running-with-bunnies
* Level 5
    * expanding-nebula

Note that I did not manage to successfully complete level 5: my solution
provides the correct answer and passes most of the test cases, but is too
inefficient to pass the last two. Attempts were made to speed-it up (hence the
different versions), but ultimately they were not enough: I ran out of both
ideas and time.
